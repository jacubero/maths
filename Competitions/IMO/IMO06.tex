\begin{enumerate}
\item
Let $ABC$ be a triangle with incentre $I$. A point $P$ in the interior of 
the triangle satisfies
\[
\angle PBA + \angle PCA = \angle PBC + \angle PCB.
\]
Show that $AP\ge AI$, and that equality holds if and only if $P=I$.

\item
Let $P$ be a regular 2006-gon. A diagonal of $P$ is called \emph{good} if 
its endpoints divide the boundary of $P$ into two parts, each composed of 
an odd number of sides of $P$. The sides of $P$ are also called 
\emph{good}.\\
Suppose $P$ has been dissected into triangles by 2003 diagonals, no two of 
which have a common point in the interior of $P$. Find the maximum number 
of isosceles triangles having two good sides that could appear in such a 
configuration.

\item
Determine the least number $M$ such that the inequality
\[
|ab(a^2-b^2)+bc(b^2-c^2)+ca(c^2-a^2)|\le M (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2
\]
holds for all real numbers $a$, $b$ and $c$.

\item
Determine all pairs $(x,y)$ of integers such that
\[
1 + 2^x + 2^{2x+1} = y^2.
\]

\item
Let $P(x)$ be a polynomial of degree $n>1$ with integer coefficients and 
let $k$ be a positive integer. Consider the polynomial $Q(x)=P(P(\dots 
P(P(x))\dots))$, where $P$ occurs $k$ times. Prove that there are at most 
$n$ integers $t$ such that $Q(t)=t$.

\item
Assign to each side $b$ of a convex polygon $P$ the maximum area of a 
triangle that has $b$ as a side and is contained in $P$. Show that the sum 
of the areas assigned to the sides of $P$ is at least twice the area of 
$P$.
