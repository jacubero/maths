At least one pair is linked by air, at least one pair by bus and at least one pair by train. No town has an air link, a bus link and a trian link. No three towns, A, B, C are such that the links between AB, AC and BC are all air, all bus or all train.

<b>4.</b>&nbsp; A convex polygon has n sides. Each vertex is joined to a point P not in the same plane. If A, B, C are adjacent vertices of the polygon take the angle between the planes PBA and PBC. The sum of the n such angles equals the sum of the n angles subtended at P by the sides of the polygon (such as the angle APB). Show that n = 3.
