\begin{enumerate} 
\item 
Find, as a function of $\, n, \,$ the sum of the digits of 
\[ 
9 \times 99 \times 9999 \times \cdots \times \left( 10^{2^n} - 1
\right), 
\] 
where each factor has twice as many digits as the 
previous 
one. 
\item 
Prove 
\[ 
\frac{1}{\cos 0\dg \cos 1\dg} +  
\frac{1}{\cos 1\dg \cos 2\dg} + \cdots + 
\frac{1}{\cos 88\dg \cos 89\dg} = 
\frac{\cos 1\dg}{\sin^2 1\dg}. 
\] 
\item 
For a nonempty set $\, S \,$ of integers, let $\, \sigma(S) \,$ 
be the sum of the elements of $\, S$.  Suppose that 
$\, A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{11} \} \,$ is a set of  
positive integers with $\, a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_{11} \,$ 
and that, for each positive integer $\, n\leq 1500, \,$ 
there is a subset  $\, S \,$ of $\, A \,$ for which 
$\, \sigma(S) = n$.   What is the smallest possible 
value of $\, a_{10}$?  
\item 
Chords $\, \overline{AA'}, \, \overline{BB'}, \, \overline{CC'} 
\,$ of a sphere meet at an interior point $\, P \,$ but are not 
contained in a plane.  The sphere through $\, A,B,C,P \,$ 
is tangent to the sphere through $\, A', B', C', P$. 
Prove that $\, AA' = BB' = CC'$. 
\item 
Let $\, P(z) \,$ be a polynomial with complex coefficients which
is of degree $\, 1992 \,$ and has distinct zeros.  Prove that 
there exist complex numbers $\, a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{1992} \,$ 
such that $\, P(z) \, $ divides the polynomial 
\[ 
\left( \cdots \left( (z-a_1)^2 - a_2 \right)^2 \cdots - a_{1991}
\right)^2 - a_{1992}. 
\]
